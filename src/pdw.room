name Pig Dungeon - Treasure Room
appearance This room is filled with treasure. There are mounds upon mounds of gold, gaudy goblets atop them. The ground is not level - there is a indentation underneath the treasure that you cannot feel the bottom of. East of you is a crossroads with a ladder in the middle, and a long corridor beyond that.
